### hey, i’m bexxo

i mess around with code  
mostly discord stuff or tools that do one thing and maybe do it kind of well  
nothing super advanced but it helps me learn

i'm into tech sure  
but also into how people work  
so stuff like psychology and philosophy is just as interesting to me as code  
sometimes more

lately i’ve been digging into cybersecurity and ethical hacking  
trying to figure out how systems break  
and what that says about the way they’re built

not everything here is finished  
most of it probably isn’t  
but that’s okay  
i’m not really aiming for perfect just for progress

**currently working on**  
a small app that lets you customize your discord rich presence  
just a side project but it’s teaching me a lot

i want to get better at writing more complex programs  
python is the first language i really try to get good at  
and honestly i’m just curious where all this will go
